/*
Personal Accountant is a simple program that allows the end user to keep track of their personal financial records on a monthy, bi-weekly and monthly basis. 

I originally wrote this program for my younger who had recently left for college. She was struggling with the idea of keeping track of how much money she was making, spending and saving. The purpose of the program is to calculate using algebraic equations the gross, net and taxable concepts into the money that is earned from her job while keeping track of a 30% rate of saving.

This is a very simple program and is initial to further developing my GitHub.com account.
