/*
Personal Accountant is a simple program that allows the end user to keep track of their personal financial records on a weekly, bi-weekly and monthly basis. 

I originally wrote this program for my younger cousin who had recently left for college. The purpose of the program is to calculate using algebraic equations.

This is a very simple program and is initial to further developing my GitHub.com account.
